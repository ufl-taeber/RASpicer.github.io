## Description
This is designed for the analysis of LC-ESI-MS data, including data which has been 13C labelled. It includes both pre-processing, interpretation and metabolite identification. Peaks are detected using XCMS, spectra can then be deconvoluted using either CAMERA or ALLocatorSD and then KEGG Compounds for putative identification and pseudo fragment spectra can be matched against MassBank. ALLocatorSD is able to process 13C labelled data, whereas CAMERA is not. Also CAMERA and ALLocatorSD used different predefined lists of adducts and neutral losses.
